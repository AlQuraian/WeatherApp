 ## Dependencies
 - [AngularJs 1.5.11](https://angularjs.org/)
 - [Semantic UI 2.2](https://semantic-ui.com/)

 ## Architecture
 There aren't much code design decisions to be made here. This is due to the fact that the requirements are simple and that AngularJs itself is opinionated, i.e. it encourages you to follow a set of patterns by default. One obvious pattern is separation of concerns, the UI/Layout code is in the HTML file, style in CSS file and the logic is in the JS/AngularJs file. I should have put some of the logic into an AngularJs service for code sharing and to make the code more maintainable, I haven't done that because of the time limitation.

 ## Please Note
 - This assignment was done in one day and that (I would have implemented the chart if I had more time)
 - My experience is in Angular 2+, rather than AngularJs.
